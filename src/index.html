        <h2>yap</h2>
        <p>im not making seperate pages for everything</p>
        <div id="1">
            <h2>my shitty electronics projects</h2>
            <h3>im making a phone i guess</h3>
            <p>its just a rpi 4b with a lte module strapped on. with a weird display
                that im set to replace.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00282.JPG" />
            <p>(and if your wondering where i get such amazing photos, its none less than the incredible sony mavica)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>most of the work is in debugging and the like. and also reading the AT command manual. the lte module
                itself
                was designed to work as a hat for the rpi zero but that just had strange issues that led me to just use
                a more powerful sbc
            </p>
            <p>
                as of now i finally have a case and working ish software for everything. runs raspberry pi os lite with
                then i3 on top. new touchscreen as well.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00289.JPG" />
            <p>
                and everything fits in this neat little case originally meant for index cards.
                its cheap and temporary but you know what they say about temporary solutions.
                perhaps i 3d print a complete case or make this a component in a broader radio cyberdeck i never
                finished building.
                this would look cool in a pelican case methinks.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00291.JPG" />
            <p>heres a better shot of the careful arangement of all the hats or shields whatever you wanna call it.
                waveshare made basically everything but the pi ofc.
                since the battery(ups hat) came with no cells i salvaged them from a drill battery.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00293.JPG" />
            <br>
            <h3>the pelican case?</h3>
            <p>
                so its in a pelican case now. and the software/hardware stack has changed a bit aswell. more batteries
                to
                be added still. keyboard is based on the dz60rgb with via and rgb yeeted and replaced with a basic qmk
                build.
                even with all this, it draws about 8w(maybe if my battery script is right) at idle with all the radios
                doing thier
                thing. not too much i guess but still enough to generate a good amount of heat and burn through the 2
                18650s on the ups hat.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00295.JPG" />
            <p>
                lots of empty room in the case below the keyboard. plan is to add standard usb-pd powerbanks, with a
                trigger board to 9v or 12v, and a buck
                down to the 8.4v the ups hat expects from the barrel jack. idk if all that will work but ill sure try.
                anything to not deal with (non usb)ac adapters
            </p>
            <img src="images/DSC00299.JPG" />
            <p>so the original goal with the software, since i didnt want to try miniaturizing, was to allow basically
                thin clients to connect over wifi or something</p>
            <img src="images/DSC00297.JPG" />
            <p>
                so i did that. i know onboard wifi has ap mode but i wanted to use a dongle i had lying around to leave
                the onboard for uplink only.
                i still have no thin clients besides a basic website.
            </p>
            <p>
                so as it stands, the cyberphonedeck thing is now a glorified router/ap with lte failover that can also
                make and
                recieve calls/sms i guess.
                for more fun i even have wireguard connected to my vps always running just cause. and i dont like isps.
                and maybe some ttl mangling to maybe avoid hotspot detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                im not really sure the direction i want to turn this. i could get a bigger screen and make this a laptop
                style cyberdeck, or perhaps run
                a little storage server, and make this the perfect battery-powered (away-from)-home lab. if its not
                clear i plan nothing ahead and
                just go with wherever the wind takes me. but a esp32 thin client is probably a bigger priority.
            </p>
            <h3>the software ?</h3>
            <p>
                not much to talk about as its such a hack job I hardly understand what ive done to get things working.
                for networking i have networkmanager for
                wifi uplink, modemmanager for lte uplink, and hostapd with dnsmasq for the AP side.
            </p>
            <p>
                the phone software is centered around a daemon that manages all the modem stuff internally and exposes a
                http api, as well as a
                a library of the same functions for if i wanted to make a different shim later on. not that i use that,
                my tui phone program i have for
                testing still uses the api. audio only works on the website one however cause it needs the browser or
                something.
                oh and all my daemon and client code is written in golang cause its
                what i know and can maintain i guess.
            </p>
            <h3>other stuff</h3>
            <p>
                and annoying tangent. maybe im just dumb at modems. but <a
                    href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/SIM7600G-H_4G_HAT_(B)">the documentation</a> for the
                hat only mentions using the onboard audio jack for phone calls. but turns out you can just send the raw
                pcm over serial and it works great. only mention
                of this is a random pdf linked at the bottom of the wiki called
                <a
                    href="https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/8/8e/SIM7100_SIM7500_SIM7600_Series_USB_AUDIO_Application_Note_V1.03.pdf">SIM7600
                    Series_USB AUDIO_Application Note</a>
                truly does work like a charm. with my server-client approach to a phone i just forward the pcm over http
                to my website client.
                i doubt using linux audio(alsa) would add much latency but why use it if the 'server' never outputs the
                audio itself. but dont listen to me
                im no software enjenir.
            </p>
            <p>
                also if for some reason you read all this and thought "why not just use modemmanager?". well i wanted to
                learn about AT commands and stuff i thought
                it'd be neat. plus concurrency stuff with handling URC's(Unsolicited Result Code). also i do use
                modemmanager just only for LTE
                cause no way im going to deal with tcp over AT commands. also modemmanager doesnt support MMS as far as
                i can find on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                also also the keyboard flashing is never documented properly anywhere i could find on the internet. as this rev 2.1 of the dz60rgb has to be flashed
                via this wacky mass storage bs. but you cant just copy over the bin you have to use dd like so 
                <pre>
                    <code>
                sudo dd if=.build/dztech_dz60rgb_v2_1_[whatever].bin \
                of=/run/media/$USER/KBDFANS/FLASH.BIN \
                bs=512 conv=notrunc oflag=direct,sync status=progress
                sync
                    </code>
                </pre>
                otherwise everything explodes and you have to reset the keyboard. which you can do by pressing the weird button on the 
                back close to the spacebar switch, or if you actually read the documentation(for which i am incapable) you can just hold esc 
                while you plug in the keyboard. otherwise everything in qmk works like a charm. to do the disabling of rgb i mentioned before 
                you just make a rules.mk that contains <code>RGB_MATRIX_ENABLE = no</code> in your keymap folder, and compile ur keymap like normal:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                qmk compile -kb dztech/dz60rgb/v2_1 -km [whatever]
                    </code>
                </pre>
                assuming ofc you have the keymap and a clean build of qmk. as if you attempt to download directly from the online configurator the builds 
                will mysteriously fail. so just use <a href="https://config.qmk.fm">the configurator</a> to get the keymap json, and use the fresh 
                clean qmk to convert it to the keymap.c 
                <pre>
                    <code>
                qmk json2c ~/[random bs name that it downloads].json \
                > keyboards/dztech/dz60rgb/v2_1/keymaps/[whatever]/keymap.c
                    </code>
                </pre>
                i should mention that this is only for this revision, <a href="documents/bs.pdf">the official docs</a> might be right for the others. but its guidance
                for this one is just plain wrong, or maybe linux handles things wrong. or i dont know anything
