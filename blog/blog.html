    <hr />

        <p style="text-align:justify;max-width: 70%;">
            photography is a hobby that i've been doing on and off for a while now.
            it started with my step-dads old camera, a sony mavica FD-92. a camera
            that uses the wonderful floppy disk as its storage medium. i never saw it as
            a limitation, as i quite like the 'lo-fi' asthetic of the pictures. this may be
            a recurring theme.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;max-width: 70%;">
            over the winter holiday, i came across a new camera,
            and here is a picture of the camera:</p>
        <img src="images/camera.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;" />
        <p style="text-align:center;max-width: 70%;">
            it is a Mintola Freedom III, a point-and-shoot camera that shoots
            135 (35mm) film. the film part is the only reason i picked it up, and it has now
            became my new hobby/hyperfixation. the worst part of film(more of an issue with
            ADHD) is how long it takes to get the pictures. but that is whatever.</p>
